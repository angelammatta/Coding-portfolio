      In this section, we will be looking at how both of us live our everyday lives from start to finish. 
      We both went to school, hung out with friends, and had our own fun after school but how we went about that was quite different because
      of our different backgrounds and different technologies. Some of our tastes may be the same now but when comparing
      myself to my grandmother when she was my age there is quite a difference.

<p  class = "sectiontext" >I start the day off by waking up and getting ready for school.
   Then I head to school, where I usually take a car or walk. 
   When I get to school, I stop by my locker to organize everything or I just head to class.
    My learning environment, topics, and tools were quite different; 
    my learning environment was quite large and the building had multiple floors while my topics and tools were more modern.
    The tools used were mostly computers and online software like Google Docs and Google Slides while topics are usually things like 
    computer science, economics, programming and science.

    After school I usually study a lot for my AP classes, especially for AP Computer Science A.
     Then I go outside to tend my garden or I study on the computer some game development topics.
      Afterwards, I wind down with some arts and crafts or play my cello. However on certain days, I have robotics club and I
       serve as the Lead Programmer so there are a lot of responsibilities I take on. I primarily train new programmers, 
       plan out the robot’s functions and program parts of the robot.

  During this time period, women did not have as many opportunities as they did now. My grandmother was not well off but she came from a well educated family so she finished school. 
  At this point, completing school up to the 5th grade was a big deal and was enough to become a teacher.
   Women could also become seamstresses, especially with big name sewing machine companies offering certifications.

  My grandma lived near a lake surrounded by white clay; They would make ovens out of this clay and cook in them. 
  She would also study a lot and do some gardening to relax. 
  It was much simpler back then as they did not have computers, phones, and tablets so they had to find other ways to have fun.
