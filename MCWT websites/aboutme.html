	<h2> About Me </h2>

     <p> My name is Angela. I am 15 years old and I would like to become a video game developer. Technology, art and music are
         everywhere in video game development, so I would be surrounded by everything I love and doing what I love for the rest of my life.
         I would program the User Interface (UI), so that people could actually play the game, or I would work on animating the characters.
         Either way, I would work alongside two departments that I still like, the writing and art department but be a member of the department I love to 
		 pieces, the programming department. After  all you cannot make a game without one of those core branches but it cannot succeed without the 
		 core business elements of the marketing and finance departments either. In any case, I like to read,draw in my spare time, as well as,
         you guessed it, play video games and practice my cello.  </p>
