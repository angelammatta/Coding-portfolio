	<h2> A Brief History of Prosthetics </h2>
	
       <p>The development of prosthetics has gone through a complete complex roller coaster as their purpose had changed over time.Prosthetics in the ancient world were used as mere decoration. People were not able to live normal lives if they lost a limb as at that time prosthetics were not functional.However,it seems that all started to change in early Egypt, where a pair of metallic toes with actual bending capabilities were found. This was the earliest form of medical prosthetics found that actually had bending capabilities.</p>

              <img id="parmovervw" src= "/images/prostheticarm.jpg" alt="iron prosthetic arm with joints made with hinges, dated back to Dark Ages"> 

			 
			 
           <p>Fast forward to the Dark Ages, where a metallic arm was found that had the sole purpose of 
           allowing a soldier to continue fighting if they lost a limb. This arm was made of iron and had hinges that allow for bending capabilities.
	        This was made by a specialist armorer because of its purpose and because of its wearer.</p>


       <p>However, that is not the  end of the complete complex roller coaster. Prosthetics continued to grow more in capability as demand grew and grew,especially during the American Civil War. The demand was so high that some war veterans were even creating their own designs and patents as they found that current designs were inadequate. The inadequacy was the fact that these prosthetics were one trick ponies that were not able to satisfy everyday tasks.</p> 
	   <p>This is where prosthetics with better joints come into play as well as plastics. As metal became more expensive, the designs switched over to plastic.Nowadays, people even 3D print their prosthetics but some go even further as robotics and automation have taken the world by storm. Robotic prosthetics are now more prevelant than ever as the capabilities and benefits they bring the amputee in question are numerous, as you will see in the rest of the site.</p>
