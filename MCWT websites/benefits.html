	<p>So what are the upsides to robotic prosthetics? Besides the fact that they are lightweight, they are also easily accessible due to the fact that some parts of the prosthetic are 3D printed.	For example, the artificial muscle tissue was 3D printed, however so could the whole entire limb for a very low cost. However the 3D printing and low cost come at a price as you truly get what you pay for when it comes to how the prosthetic looks and acts. Sometimes there maybe delay between the prosthetic and the signal sent from the brain but because of the high cost of robotic prosthetics that are of very high quality, as in ranging from 2,000 USD to 10,000 USD, this maybe the only choice for some.</p>
	 
	 <img id="hndbnfts" src="/images/prosthetichand.jpg" alt="3D printed prosthetic hand ">
	 
	 <p> This was a robotic prosthetic created by a team of college students at the University of Manchester. They 3D printed the outer layer and joints but also did the wiring on their own. The prosthetic hand went to an amputee who could not afford the staggering cost of robotic prosthetics. It may not be 
     sleek and it may not be of the highest quality but it gets the job done at an astonishing 307 British pounds, which translates to 396.87 USD. Hopefully as time goes on, the price of robotic prosthetics decreases as new advancements are made, but only time will tell. </p>
	
	 <p>Hopefully, this put into perspective how lucky you are to even have all of your limbs as high quality robotic prosthetics cost literally an arm and a leg. Despite this unfortunate high price tag, robotic prosthetics have helped amputees greatly and have made having a normal life a possibilty for 
	 them, as they maybe the veterans that have served our country to the many that suffer from car crashes each year. They have at least some semblance of normalcy all thanks to robotic prosthetics. After all if you lost a piece of yourself, would you not want it back? </p>
