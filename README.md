# Coding-portfolio
//ACTUAL DESCRIPTION Updated: January 12th 2024
My name is Angela Matta, I am a computer science major  at the University of Michigan



This programming portfolio contains work that is entirely developed myself unless otherwise stated. At this point in time, I will never/have never use AI for development; if that changes in the future, I will disclose that in the README file of the project in question. 

The projects fall under the following categories:
Data Science
AI and Machine Learning
Software Engineering 

At this point in time, the projects in this repository are mostly class work from my high school and college courses. 



//ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION FOR REFERENCE
This is my programming portfolio which will contain all of my work from not only AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A but also from the various college courses 
that I have taken and some personal proejcts. For AP Computer Science Principles, I used Code.org so please note that the code may only work in their programming environment while I used Java for 
AP Computer Science A. 

My AP Computer Science A teacher had us do a data science project and a machine learning project, which was programmed in Google Colab. 

I will update this as I move forward so stay tuned. Please only use this for educational purposes with proper credit and not in place of schoolwork or any other work 
that is to submitted as your own. If you are caught plagiarizing then there will be consequences from your school, the College Board or even the
organization hosting that competition you decided to enter. 

Also each section is set up to be in its own branch for easier viewing.
