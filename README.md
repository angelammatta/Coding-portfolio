# Coding-portfolio

This is my programming portfolio which will contain all of my work from not only AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A but also from the various college courses 
that I have taken and some personal proejcts. For AP Computer Science Principles, I used Code.org so please note that the code may only work in their programming environment while I used Java for 
AP Computer Science A. 

My AP Computer Science A teacher had us do a data science project and a machine learning project, which was programmed in Google Colab. 

I will update this as I move forward so stay tuned. Please only use this for educational purposes with proper credit and not in place of schoolwork or any other work 
that is to submitted as your own. If you are caught plagiarizing then there will be consequences from your school, the College Board or even the
organization hosting that competition you decided to enter.
