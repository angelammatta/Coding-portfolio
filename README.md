# Coding-portfolio
This my coding portfolio, where I will keep my projects. It will be everything from websites to freelance projects. I will also be putting everything that I programmed in AP Computer Science Principles in here as well. 


This is to not be edited by anyone else! If you want good examples on the usage of HTML5 and CSS3 to create a website as well as examples of certain projects that will be done as apart of AP Computer Science Principles in Javascript then you have come to the right place. Please do bare in mind that the Javascript was programmed in the Code.org interface as that was used for the AP course I took. 


Also I am going to be taking AP Computer Science A and a few coding classes during the summer too.
