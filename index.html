A little short introduction is needed before you take a tour of the whole website.  In regards to the theme, there is not only a difference in time period between myself and my grandmother but also a difference in culture; my grandmother is from Lebanon while I am from the United States so certain aspects may be even more different than if I  were to  just compare our  two time periods.  With that out of the way, I hope you enjoy!

<p  class = "sectiontext" >My likes and skills do differ due to the technological advancements within the last few decades.
   However, they do partially align because my mother introduced some of these topics to me and due to the fact that I came a family 
   that did not have much either. I love sewing but I use a sewing machine a lot more than my grandmother. I also love video games and doing arts and crafts, like sculpting
   with polymer clay,digital art and knitting. </p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle">Skills and Interests</h2>


<p class = "sectiontext">My grandma’s likes and skills stem a lot from what she had access to since she did not grow up with many luxuries because 
  she did not come from a well off family. It was also a different time with different opportunities 
  and different technological advancements so what was available at the time to the public was quite different. My grandmother
  likes cooking, watching soap operas, knitting and sewing by hand.
